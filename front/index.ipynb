        "In this project I aim to develop a generalizable novel methodology for identifying website list in a target category. And I will use \"dangerous website\" as an example to demonstrate my methodology. Finally I will analyze the characteristics of dangerous websites via calsual inference.\n",

        "To be more specific, I will answer the following questions in this project:\n",
        "\n",
        "* 1. ***How to ascertain whether a website belongs to a specific website category without having a dataset?***\n",
        " Not every classification comes with a \"ground truth\" available for our study. Therefore, I aim to develop a method to determine whether a website falls into a given category in the absence of \"ground truth\".(i.e. Input: Category defination, website list.  Output: Website which belongs to this category).\n",
        " We will use \"dangerous website\" as an example.\n",

        "    + Construct a website list without ground truth.(**Core contribution**)\n",
        "        - Download some pre-trained model from Huggingface.\n",
        "        - Compare the performance of different models and choose the best one as the teacher model.\n",
        "        - Use the teacher-student model to train a student model.\n",
        "        - Use the student model's proformance to evaluate the teacher model's performance and fine-tune the teacher model.\n",
        "        - Use a well-known dataset (AD DataSet) to evaluate our model.\n",
        "        - Use the model to predict the website list.\n",
        "* Identifying and characterizing \"dangerous\" websites:\n",
        "    Initially I will use causal inference to analyze the characteristics of dangerous websites. Crawling the ad, tracker and script information of the website, and then use causal inference to analyze the characteristics of dangerous websites.(***NEED TO READ MORE PAPER.***)\n"

        "In this project I aim to develop a generalizable novel methodology for identifying website list in a target category. And I will use \"danguage\" as an example to demonstrate my methodology. Finally I will analyze the characteristics of dangerous websites via calsual inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be more specific, I will answer the following questions in this project:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. How to ascertain whether a website belongs to a specific website category without having a dataset? Not every classification comes with a \"ground truth\" available for our study. Therefore, I aim to develop a method to determine whether a website falls into a given category in the absence of \"ground truth\".(i.e. Input: Category defination, website list.  Output: Website which belongs to this category).\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Case study: How to identify dangerous websites? I will use \"dangerous websites\" as an example to demonstrate my methodology. I will develop a method to identify dangerous websites and analyze the characteristics of dangerous websites via calsual inference(**Not sure which method for this part**).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this projcet I aim to create a list of dangerous websites and conduct a feature analysis on the websites in this list. I want to determine what kinds of websites are more likely to be considered dangerous, what characteristics dangerous websites have, and observe the trackers and advertisements on these websites. I wish to understand how to identify dangerous websites and whether we can predict dangerous websites. I believe that dangerous websites are a collection of certain types of websites. Through this work, we could better identify dangerous websites. Zeng[^1] proposed how to identify a bad advertisement in 2021, which provided ideas for my work. Englehardt and others analyzed the security of popular websites in 2016[^2], but no one has analyzed a large scale of specific types of websites, so my work should be meaningful.\n",

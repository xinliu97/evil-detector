# evil-detector
Evil-Detector is a sophisticated tool designed to identify and analyze dangerous websites based on a large scale data research.



The project website is available at: https://cyh.georgetown.domains/documation/_site/index.html

This website may change when I have money to buy a domain name and server instead of using my friend's server. :(
